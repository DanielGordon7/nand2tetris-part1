In part 1 of the course we build a computer from scratch in the span of 6 weeks and 6 projects.

All the hardware chips are build in a Hardware Simulator using a simple custom HDL (Hardware Description Language).

This repo contains all solutions to the projects with useful comments explaining the code.
